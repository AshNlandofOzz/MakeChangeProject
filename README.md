# MakeChangeProject
This project is complete for my first attempt.

#Bugs
While this project does meet all the qualifications, there is a bug that I have encountered difficulty with. The cents that are published by my equation are not two decimals. They are often much longer. This creates a pub with the denominations.

#Reasons for the Bug
I am sure this is being caused as the information is passed from a Double to and Int so I can isolate the denominations. That being said, I am unsure as of right now how to fix this bug, but plan on investigating further through the weekend to try to find a solution, though I am unsure at my level of knowledge that I will find a better solution by the assignment due date so I am pushing my current work to ensure I meet deadline.

Thank you.
